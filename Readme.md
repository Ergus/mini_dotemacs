Simple emacs configuration with many improvements without any external
package.

The idea is to have an emacs config that loads as efficiently as
possible and could be ported in machines without network connection or
access to elpa or melpa.

This config supports emacs 31.0.5 (pre-release). Some older versions
may work as well, but I have not tested them.

Previously I used to fully support and test the older versions of
emacs, but I have found that most GNU/Linux distributions tend to
support ridiculously old versions that result almost un-functional for
my use cases.

Installation
------------

If you are reading this part probably you don't have any previous
emacs configuration. So maybe you only need to do:

```
cd ~
git clone this_repo_url .emacs.d
```
