Simple emacs configuration with many improvements without any external
package.

The idea is to have an emacs config that loads as efficiently as
possible and could be ported in machines without network connection or
access to elpa or melpa.

This config requires emacs 29 because many of the functionalities
enabled are only available in emacs 29 (or higher).

Installation
------------

If you are reading this part probably you don't have any previous
emacs configuration. So maybe you only need to do:

```
cd ~
git clone this_repo_url .emacs.d
```
